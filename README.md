# IAD Lab Experience Website

## Overview
The **IAD Lab Experience Website** showcases our journey in the **IAD Lab Competition**, where we collaborated with **Group 7** under the esteemed supervision of **Dr. Humera Tariq**. This platform highlights our experiences, insights, and learnings from the competition.

During the competition, we developed a **Math Quiz Game**, which serves as a solution to **Problem #4.22** from the book *"Web Technologies - A Computer Science Perspective"*.

## Math Quiz Game - Problem Statement
> **Write a JavaScript program that generates 10 random math problems.** Each problem should consist of **three operands** (random integers between **âˆ’10 and 10**) and **two operators** (randomly chosen from **+, -, *, and %**).  
> For example, a problem might be `-4 + 7 % 3`. The user should enter an integer representing the computed result (following standard JavaScript operator precedence).  
> After answering all 10 problems, display the number of correct answers.
